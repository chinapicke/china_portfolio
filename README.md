# Portfolio

## Description
Portfolio to showcase what I have developed so far throught the course. The purpose of this portfolio is so that it can be show cased to other for future job prospects. This portfolio uses HTML and CSS. Within CSS, I have used grids to layout the page, whilst using nested grids to display content within grid items. A scroll function has alos been applied to allow smooth scrolling along the browser. I have not added any information into the "About Me" aspect of the page, but I have used text filler. Hopefully I will be able to ill this in throughoyt the course. There is also media queries included incase the webpage is to be viewed on a smaller screen (such as a phone). Some application images can be pressed to divert user to a new page.
